# Discord: Quantum Distribution
https://anaxias.github.io

A Discord Hack Week project and beyond.

## gameplay

You control a quantum robot hamster to deliver messages sent by people on the server.

Use your mouse to move the hamster around the Discord server and push quantum messages into their respective channels.
Messages that hit the wrong channel will bring down the server integrity, so watch out!

#Future plans
1) Make it possible to pick up messages instead of just pushing them around.
2) Fix somewhat glitchy movement with hamster
3) Make users and channels dynamically created so you see a different set each game.
4) Vary the message spawn more
5) Add a Time To Live (TTL) to the messages, so that if they pass that time limit, they will disappear forever.
6) Add "happiness" levels to the Discord users, which will show when they lose messages or if their messages get sent to the wrong channel.
7) More feedback animations for: when users create a message, when messages collide with channels, and when HP bar adjusts.
8) Animate the hamster!!!
9) Add more random quicktime events, like voice chats, video/screen sharing, and @everyone messages
